# how to set up and run the project

Initailly when we fetch the code from github there will be no node modules we have to install them using command "npm i".
It will take time to install the modules. When the modules will be installed we can run the program using comand "npm run serve".

# Design Choices

For design I have used Vue Bootstrap and custom Css.
Botstrap is used for layout management and css for styling the coponents.
As this project is made in Vuejs and other liberaries i have used like state management with Vuex, routing with Vue Router, axios, and integrates easily with third-party libraries like BootstrapVue.
Other than that in this project I have worked on form validations, Error handeling, Api handeling with the help of Axios.
